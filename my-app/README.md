# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Cloud Sync (Supabase)

This app supports syncing tasks across devices via Supabase.

Setup:
- Create a Supabase project
- Create table `tasks` with columns:
  - `id` text primary key
  - `title` text
  - `description` text
  - `due_date` timestamptz
  - `priority` text
  - `completed` boolean
  - `created_at` timestamptz
  - `updated_at` timestamptz
- Set environment variables (in your shell) used by `app.json` extra before running:

```bash
set SUPABASE_URL=your-url
set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Sync behavior:
- Offline-first: tasks are stored locally
- Pull remote and push local on pull-to-refresh
- Last-write-wins via `updatedAt`

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
